Readme and notes

Todo
- Enable window messages so we can send message to enable/disable instead of injecting script
- Should we remove script object after we inject it to keep DOM clean?
- Look at 'Context for Chrome' in app store to see if it helps us manage chrome extensions
- Add something to Ox topbar to indicate there is a chrome extension active
- Add banner ad to advertising extension
- Pull extensions out so they can be delivered as .crx files from my public file folder or from the selector
- Send to Raf as soon as I can.


Questions
- How do I register a portal widget at run time?
- How do we use LESS and can I change or use @@ definitions at run time?
- Are we going to officially support themes again?
- How do I remove an application
- How do I selectively disable existing apps?
- How can I leverage oAuth


Ideas for extensions
- App that wraps existing app in an iFrame.  Think Zimbra in AppSuite.  Advanced, ep can modify existing app by injecting code
- Add up-sell links
- Customer pre-build customizer.  Prompt for logo, colors, select apps to enable/disable and see changes in real-time
- Send to Evernote
- Send to Dropbox
- Full portal widget, with oAuth
- 'Maxwell' quick note
- Send to self
- Move to pre-defined folder, ie archive
- Think about collection of extensions as OxLabs which can be enabled/disabled
- Use simple editor at 'io.ox/editor/main' ?
- Ox Text examples?
- Parse text for calendar, address, etc
From Google Labs
- Undo send - would hook send button and delay N seconds then trigger actual send
- Canned responses - Send selected template mail
